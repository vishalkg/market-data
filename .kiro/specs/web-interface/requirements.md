# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds an HTTPS web interface to the Market Data MCP Server via AWS Lambda, enabling access from any device (desktop/mobile) when MCP integration is unavailable. The implementation follows a phased approach:

**Phase 1 (This Spec):** Build CDK infrastructure, Lambda function, and web UI with dummy data responses
**Phase 2 (Future):** Integrate with refactored core logic after existing refactoring PR is merged

This spec focuses exclusively on Phase 1 - establishing the web infrastructure and UI with mock responses for all 14 existing MCP tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lambda Function with Mock Responses

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Lambda function that responds to tool requests with realistic dummy data, so that I can validate the infrastructure before integrating real data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda receives a tool request THEN it SHALL return mock data matching the expected schema for that tool
2. WHEN `get_stock_quote` is called THEN it SHALL return dummy quote data (symbol, price, volume, etc.)
3. WHEN `get_fundamentals` is called THEN it SHALL return dummy fundamental data (PE ratio, market cap, etc.)
4. WHEN `get_options_chain` is called THEN it SHALL return dummy options data (strikes, premiums, Greeks)
5. IF an unsupported tool is requested THEN it SHALL return a clear error message

### Requirement 2: Lambda Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to access market data tools via HTTPS endpoints, so that I can query stock data from any device without MCP client setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda receives an HTTP request THEN it SHALL parse the tool name and parameters from the URL path
2. WHEN Lambda processes a request THEN it SHALL route to the appropriate mock data function
3. WHEN mock data is generated THEN Lambda SHALL serialize it to JSON for HTTP response
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN Lambda SHALL return appropriate HTTP error responses (400, 500, etc.)
5. IF authentication fails THEN Lambda SHALL return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 3: Web Interface with Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want a secure web interface with login protection, so that only authorized users can access my market data tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Lambda Function URL THEN they SHALL see a login page with secret input
2. WHEN a user enters the correct token (`ddg@9812`) THEN they SHALL be granted access to the tools page
3. WHEN a user enters an incorrect token THEN they SHALL see "Access Denied" message
4. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the session SHALL persist in sessionStorage until logout or browser close
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN sessionStorage SHALL be cleared and they SHALL return to login page
6. IF a user tries to access tool endpoints without a valid token THEN they SHALL receive a 403 error

### Requirement 4: Tool Execution Interface

**User Story:** As a web interface user, I want to execute market data tools through a simple form, so that I can query stock quotes, fundamentals, and options data from my browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN they SHALL see input fields for tool selection and parameters
2. WHEN a user submits a tool request THEN the Lambda function SHALL execute the corresponding core logic
3. WHEN tool execution succeeds THEN the response SHALL be displayed as formatted JSON
4. WHEN tool execution fails THEN an error message SHALL be displayed to the user
5. IF a tool requires parameters (e.g., symbol) THEN the UI SHALL provide appropriate input fields

### Requirement 5: AWS Infrastructure Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want one-click deployment of the Lambda infrastructure, so that I can quickly set up the web interface without manual AWS configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `./deploy.sh` is executed THEN it SHALL deploy all AWS resources via CDK
2. WHEN deployment completes THEN it SHALL output the Lambda Function URL
3. WHEN CDK stack is defined THEN it SHALL include Lambda function, Function URL, and IAM permissions
4. WHEN Lambda is deployed THEN it SHALL have Python 3.12 runtime, 128MB memory, and 30s timeout
5. IF deployment fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6: Multi-Tool Support

**User Story:** As a web interface user, I want access to all available MCP tools, so that I can perform comprehensive market analysis through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface loads THEN it SHALL support all 14 existing MCP tools with mock responses
2. WHEN a user selects `get_stock_quote` THEN they SHALL receive dummy stock price data
3. WHEN a user selects `get_fundamentals` THEN they SHALL receive dummy company fundamental data
4. WHEN a user selects `get_options_chain` THEN they SHALL receive dummy professional options data
5. IF a tool is selected THEN the UI SHALL display the mock response in formatted JSON

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in Lambda THEN it SHALL be logged to CloudWatch Logs
2. WHEN a tool request fails THEN the error SHALL include the tool name and parameters
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN it SHALL be logged without exposing the token
4. WHEN a tool is executed THEN request parameters and execution time SHALL be logged
5. IF an unexpected error occurs THEN it SHALL return a 500 error with a generic message

### Requirement 8: Cost Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Lambda deployment to be cost-effective, so that I can run the service for under $1/month.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda is configured THEN it SHALL use minimal memory (128MB) for cost efficiency
2. WHEN Lambda is idle THEN it SHALL incur no compute costs (pay-per-invocation)
3. WHEN the system is used at 20 calls/day THEN monthly cost SHALL be under $1
4. WHEN Function URL is used THEN it SHALL not require API Gateway (additional cost)
5. IF usage increases THEN costs SHALL scale linearly with invocations

### Requirement 9: Mobile and Desktop Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to work on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can access market data from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI is loaded on desktop THEN it SHALL display properly in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
2. WHEN the UI is loaded on mobile THEN it SHALL be responsive and usable on small screens
3. WHEN a user bookmarks the Function URL THEN they SHALL be able to access it directly
4. WHEN the UI is used on mobile THEN form inputs SHALL be appropriately sized for touch interaction
5. IF the browser doesn't support sessionStorage THEN it SHALL display a compatibility warning

### Requirement 10: Security Best Practices

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the web interface to follow security best practices, so that my market data access is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL use HTTPS (AWS-managed SSL certificate)
2. WHEN the token is stored THEN it SHALL be in sessionStorage (not localStorage or cookies)
3. WHEN the login page is displayed THEN it SHALL not reveal any hints about the system
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the token SHALL be in query parameters (protected by HTTPS)
5. IF the browser is closed THEN the session SHALL be automatically cleared
